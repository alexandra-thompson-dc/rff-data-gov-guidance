## Introduce Yourself to Git

First, open Git Bash.  (Hit the windows key and type "bash")


## Introduce Yourself to Git {auto-animate="true"}

First, open Git Bash.  (Hit the windows key and type "bash")

```bash
RFF@Theophilus MINGW64 ~
$ 
```

## Introduce Yourself to Git {auto-animate=true}

Now, let's ask Git what version we are running:

```bash
RFF@Theophilus MINGW64 ~
$ git --version
```

## Introduce Yourself to Git {auto-animate=true}

Now, let's ask Git what version we are running:

```bash
RFF@Theophilus MINGW64 ~
$ git --version
git version 2.47.0.windows.2
```

## new page

In the Git Bash window, you can type all kinds of commands, including Git commands, which are always prependended with "git", or bash commands that are commonly run in terminals.

Let's start with:

```bash
git --version
```

It should have printed out what version you are running, something like `git version 1.47.0.windows.2`.  Now, let's introduce ourselves to Git:

```bash
git config --global user.name 'Your Name Here'
git config --global user.email 'your-name-here@rff.org'
git config --global --list
```

Now, Git will include your name and email when you publish changes.
