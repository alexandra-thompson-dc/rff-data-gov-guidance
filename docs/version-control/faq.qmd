#### What types of files can I store in my repository?
Any filetype will “work” with version control, in that you can add them to the repository. However, one of the biggest perks of version control is the ability to see specific changes to files.
That feature only works for files composed of human-readable characters, examples of which include comma-separated values (.csv) and plain text (.txt), as well as source code.
However, there are some commonly-used filetypes that are not human-readable, and thus do not work very well with version control, including:

* Any Microsoft office format (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, etc.)
* MATLAB notebooks (.mlx)
* It is also not advisable to store large data files in git.
For storing large files, see the [Storage Options section](../data-management/storage-options.qmd)

#### What if there is a file in my local repository that I don’t want in the remote repository?
Great question!
If I may want to add that file to the repository later, I could simply avoid staging it for current commit, and stage it when it is ready later.
If that file or folder should never be tracked, you can also create a file called `.gitignore` in the repository.
Inside the file, you can simply add the names of the file(s), folder(s), or file extension types (i.e. `*.log`) that you wish for Git to ignore.Generally, it is good to ignore files/folders that get automatically generated by existing scripts, are too big for git, or are not relevant to other users of the repository.  Here are some examples of files that you may consider adding to a `.gitignore` file:

* a folder containing intermediate data files
* a folder containing dependencies that get downloaded using a script
* a project file created by a code editor


#### What if I don’t have anyone who can review my code or pull request?
The importance and benefits of code review was presented in the Software Quality section of the guidance <TODO: LINK TO SUBSECTION>.
If you don’t have anyone working on a project with you who is available to review your code, feel free to reach out to <TODO: figure out if this is something we can support>
